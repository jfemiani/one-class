  abstract      = {The One Class Classification ({OCC}) problem is different from the conventional binary/multi-class classification problem in the sense that in {OCC}, the negative class is either not present or not properly sampled. The problem of classifying positive (or target) cases in the absence of appropriately-characterized negative cases (or outliers) has gained increasing attention in recent years. Researchers have addressed the task of {OCC} by using different methodologies in a variety of application domains. In this paper we formulate a taxonomy with three main categories based on the way {OCC} has been envisaged, implemented and applied by various researchers in different application domains. We also present a survey of current state-of-the-art {OCC} algorithms, their importance, applications and limitations.},
