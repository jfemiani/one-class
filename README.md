Thesis formatted according to the ASU online formatting tool. 
The current files pass the format requirements in spring 2013.

I reccomend the following tools for editing this:
* JabRef -- for managing the references. 
* TexStudio -- for writing the LaTeX. thesis.tex should be set as the document root. 

For organizing the documents:
* Figures should be saved in a scaleble format (e.g. as .pdf files) at the desired final size. 
* Figures should be put under a './figs' folder. 
* 

From the original asudis README:
Email john.shumwayjr@gmail.com if you are a graduating ASU student with LaTeX questions.
